{{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

1. Describe the Problem
   Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

# As a user

So that I can improve my grammar
I want to verify that a text starts with a capital letter and ends with a suitable sentence-ending punctuation mark. 2. Design the Method Signature
Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects.
'''ruby
is_correct = check_grammar(text)

# text is a string with words in it

# is_correct is a boolean depending on whether it checks out

3. Create Examples as Tests
   Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return.

# EXAMPLE

1.  check_grammar("")=> fail "Not a sentence."
2.  check_grammar("Hello world.") => true
3.  check_grammar("Hello world") => false
4.  check_grammar("hello world.") => false
5.  check_grammar("HELLO world.") => true
6.  check_grammar("Hello world!") => true
7.  check_grammar("Hello world?") => true
8.  check_grammar("Hello world,") => false

9.  Implement the Behaviour
    After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
